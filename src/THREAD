The program illustrate the implementation of a Thread class using a derived class MyThread.Note that the Thread class is imported from the java.lang package hence it is an in built class(it's body is not defined in the program).
the line #thread.start() starts a new thread, This internally invokes the run() method in a separate thread,hence it is not correct to access the run() method directly using the statement #thread.run()

//more explanation
MyThread thread=new MyThread();
thread.start();
This creates a new, independent thread named Thread and starts it
processing.Whatever thread does, it does as an independent thread

The method start() initiates the computation (process) of the calling
thread. It performs some overhead associated with starting a thread and then it invokes
the run method for the thread
